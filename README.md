## Problem statement
Hackillinois 2021 project on rekindling connection theme
Both within and outside of the professional environment, your success depends on how you interact with others. Human beings are social animals and thus thrive on connection with others. Unfortunately, due to extenuating factors, many people don’t fully realize the extent of their relationship with other people.
At times People stop putting in the work necessary to keep their relationships alive.
Reconnecting with someone you’ve lost touch with might be an excellent way to rekindle your past contacts and revive that spark in your social life again.

## Idea/Solution
As a solution we aim to build a contact manager with reminders to keep in touch with people who matter most, embrace deep relationships instead of many loose connections, breaks the user free from social media apps like Facebook.
