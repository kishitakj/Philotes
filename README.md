### Inspiration

It’s great to catch up. But it's not so easy anymore with the contacts are spread over many 
places. Mixed with people you don’t know. Cluttered social media profiles, baggage of comments, texts, posts. It feels like a chore. No time for the joy of meeting up.

And life changes. You move to new places. You change jobs. You travel and meet people. You 
join events with cool people. But months of work follow. They stop to appear in feeds and inboxes. Instead of fun reunites relationships fade.

## Problem statement
Hackillinois 2021 project on rekindling connection theme
Both within and outside of the professional environment, your success depends on how you interact with others. Human beings are social animals and thus thrive on connection with others. Unfortunately, due to extenuating factors, many people don’t fully realize the extent of their relationship with other people.
At times People stop putting in the work necessary to keep their relationships alive.
Reconnecting with someone you’ve lost touch with might be an excellent way to rekindle your past contacts and revive that spark in your social life again.
## Idea/Solution

As a solution we aim to build an app which reminds us to keep in touch with people who matter, to whom we have lost touch for long time, to embrace deep relationships instead of  connections getting lost and not rely completely on social media which often can be a source to anxiety and noise for one's well-being in the present
